# RPM

We use Centos 6 on our servers and deploy all our projects from rpm.

Centrifugo isn't an exclusion so you can find everything to create rpm [in its
repository](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo/tree/master/extras/rpm).

Please read README file from link above to see how you can build rpm for Centrifugo
release.
