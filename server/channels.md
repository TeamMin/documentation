# Channels

Channel is a route for messages.

Clients can subscribe on channel to receive events related to this channel - new
messages, join/leave events etc. Also client must be subscribed on channel to get
presence or history information.

Channel is just a string - ``news``, ``comments`` are valid channel names.

**BUT!** You should remember several things.

First, channel name length is limited by `255` characters by default (can
be changed via configuration file option `max_channel_length`)

Second, `:`, `#` and `$` symbols have a special role in channel name.

### namespace channel boundary

``:`` - is a namespace boundary.

If channel is `public:chat` - then Centrifuge will apply options to this channel
from namespace with name `public`.

### user channel boundary

`#` is a user boundary - separator to create private channels for users without sending
POST request to your web application. For example if channel is `news#user42` then only
user `user42` can subscribe on this channel (Centrifugo knows user ID as clients provide
it when connecting)

Moreover you can provide several user IDs in channel name separated by comma: `dialog#user42,user43` â€“
in this case only `user42` and `user43` will be able to subscribe on this channel.

### private channel prefix

If channel starts with `$` then it considered private. Subscription on private channel
must be properly signed by your web application. Read special chapter in docs about
private channel subscriptions.
