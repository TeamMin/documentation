Now you know how Centrifugo server implemented and how it works. It's time to connect your
web application users to the server from web browser.

For this purpose Centrifugal offers javascript client with simple API.

The source code of javascript client located in its own [repo on Github](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js).

Javascript client can connect to the server in two ways: using pure Websockets or using
SockJS library to be able to use various available fallback transports if client browser
does not support Websockets.

If you've never heard about SockJS - [follow this link](https://github.com/sockjs/sockjs-client) to
get more information about this beautiful library.

With javascript client you can:

* connect your user to real-time server
* subscribe on channel and listen for all new messages published into this channel
* get presence information for channel (all clients currently subscribed on channel)
* get history messages for channel
* receive join/leave events for channels (when someone subscribes on channel or unsubscribes from it)
* publish new messages into channels

*Note, that in order to use presence, history, join/leave and publish â€“ corresponding options
must be enabled in Centrifugo channel configuration (for project in general or for namespace).*
