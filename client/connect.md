# Connection parameters

As we showed earlier to initialize centrifuge object you must write the following code:

```javascript
<script type="text/javascript">

    var centrifuge = new Centrifuge({
        url: 'http://centrifugo.example.com/connection',
        project: 'PROJECT KEY',
        user: 'USER ID',
        timestamp: 'UNIX TIMESTAMP',
        token: 'TOKEN'
    });

</script>
```

Let's see for what each option is responsible for.

### url

`url` â€“ is an endpoint of Centrifugo server to connect to.

If your Centrifugo server sits on domain `centrifugo.example.com` then

* SockJS endpoint will be `http://centrifugo.example.com/connection`
* Pure Websocket endpoint will be `ws://centrifugo.example.com/connection/websocket`

Remember to include SockJS library on your page when you want to use SockJS.

If your Centrifugo works through SSL then endpoint addresses must start with
`https`(SockJS) and `wss`(Websocket) instead of `http` and `wss`

You can also set `url` to just `http://centrifugo.example.com` and javascript client will
detect which endpoint to use (SockJS or Websocket) automatically based on SockJS library availability.

### project

`project` string is your project key from Centrifugo configuration.

### user

`user` string is your web application's current user ID. It can be empty if you don't have logged in user
but you must enable `anonymous` access option for channels in Centrifugo project/namespace configuration.

### timestamp

`timestamp` string is UNIX server time in seconds when connection token (see below) was generated. For example
for Python this is `"%.0f" % time.time()` (or just `str(int(time.time()))`)

### token

`token` is a digest string generated by your web application based on project secret key,
project key, user ID, timestamp.

To create token HMAC sha256 algorithm is used. To understand how to generate client connection token see
special chapter "Tokens and signatures".

Correct token guarantees that connection request to Centrifugo contains valid
information about project key, user ID and timestamp. Token is similar to HTTP cookie, client must never
show it to anyone else. Also remember that you must always use private channels when working with confidential
data.

If you are using Python - then you can use `generate_client_token` function from `Cent` library to
generate tokens for your users.

# info

You can optionally provide extra parameter `info` when connecting to Centrifuge:

```javascript
var centrifuge = new Centrifuge({
    url: 'http://centrifuge.example.com/connection',
    project: 'PROJECT KEY',
    user: 'USER ID',
    timestamp: 'UNIX TIMESTAMP',
    info: '{"first_name": "Alexandr", "last_name": "Emelin"}',
    token: 'TOKEN'
});

`info` is an additional information about connection. It must be encoded JSON string. But to prevent
client sending wrong `info` this JSON string must be used while generating token.

If you don't want to use `info` - you can omit this parameter while connecting to Centrifugo. But if you
omit it then make sure that info string have not been used in token generation.

### protocols_whitelist

In case of using SockJS additional configuration parameter can be used - `protocols_whitelist`.

It defines allowed SockJS transports and by default equals ['websocket', 'xdr-streaming', 'xhr-streaming',
'iframe-eventsource', 'iframe-htmlfile', 'xdr-polling', 'xhr-polling', 'iframe-xhr-polling',
'jsonp-polling'] i.e. all possible SockJS transports.

### debug

`debug` is a boolean option which is `false` by default. When enabled some debug messages will be
logged into javascript console.
