# Client libraries to communicate with Centrifugo

This chapter is about client libraries. Centrifugo originally created to work with browser
clients. But Websocket protocol built on top of convenient TCP and is very simple and popular
so it's very easy to find Websocket client for almost every existing language and write
client for Centrifugo on top of it. So we have client libraries to work from iOS and Android 
devices. Also we have some clients for other languages.

If you want to help and create client for other languages or contribute into existing ones â€“
your help is very appreciated!

In this section we will look at Javascript client API in detail - it covers almost all aspects 
you can come across when working with Centrifugo. In other client implementations you have 
similar APIs - see documentation for specific client.
