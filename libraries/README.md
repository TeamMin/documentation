# Libraries to communicate with server API

As you could see in Centrifugal overview there are
two officially supported libraries for communicating with server
API at moment - [for Python](https://github.com/centrifugal/cent) and [for Ruby](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-ruby).

If you don't find a library for your favorite language â€“ you can go completely
without it. You have an option to publish via Redis Engine or just implement
calls to HTTP API yourself - [see server API description](server/api.md).
