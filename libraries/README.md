# Libraries to communicate with server API

As you could see in Centrifugal overview there are several officially supported libraries
for communicating with server API at moment.

If you have not found a library for your favorite language â€“ you can go completely
without it. You have an option to publish via Redis Engine or just implement
calls to HTTP API yourself - [see server API description](../server/api.md).

Also note that [Cent](https://github.com/centrifugal/cent) contains everything you
need to communicate with server API - so if you have questions - just look at
its source code as reference - as it is written in Python it's very easy to read
and understand. And there are few lines of code actually.
