# Libraries to communicate with server API

As you could see in chapter about Centrifugal projects there are
two officially supported libraries for communicating with Centrifugo
API - [for Python](https://github.com/centrifugal/cent) and [for Ruby](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-ruby).

If you don't find a library for your favorite language â€“ it's not too difficult
to go without it. You have an option to publish via Redis Engine or just implement
calls to API yourself - this is not so difficult and was described here in section
about server implementation.
