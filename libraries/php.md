# PHP server API client

We have two actual API clients for PHP.

The first one is HTTP API client created by Dmitriy Soldatenko. You can find it [on Github](https://github.com/sl4mmer/phpcent).
It's simple to use - just follow its README and enjoy communicating with Centrifugo HTTP API.

Another API client developed by [Oleh Ozimok](https://github.com/oleh-ozimok) - [php-centrifugo](https://github.com/oleh-ozimok/php-centrifugo).
It allows to work with Redis Engine API queue. See more detailed description in library README.
