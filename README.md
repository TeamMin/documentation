Centrifugal organization is a set of tools to add real-time features on your web site.

It brings together several repositories linked by a common purpose – give you a complete
and ready to use solution when you want to add real-time events into your web application.
Chats, real-time graphs, notifications, counters and even games can be built using our
instruments – real-time messaging server, javascript browser client and client libraries
for your favorite language.

Our real-time server easily integrates with your existing web site – you don't need
to change your project architecture and philosophy to get real-time events.

There are tons of examples in internet about how to add real-time events on your site. But
very few of them provide complete, scalable, full-featured, ready to deploy solution.
Centrifugal organization aims to give such a solution with simplicity in mind.
