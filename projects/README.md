# Centrifugal projects

Let's see which projects Centrifugal has:

* [centrifuge](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge) - real-time messaging server written in Python.
* [centrifugo](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifugo) - real-time messaging server written in Go. This is a brand-new almost drop-in replacement for Centrifuge. It has several advantages over Python version and hopefully will be the only supported server implementation in future.
* [centrifuge-web](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-web) - admin web interface for Centrifuge/Centrifugo. Built on ReactJS.
* [centrifuge-js](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js) - Javascript client to connect to messaging server from web browser.
* [cent](https://github.com/centrifugal/cent) - Python tools to communicate with Centrifuge/Centrifugo.
* [adjacent](https://github.com/centrifugal/adjacent) - a small wrapper over Cent to simplify Centrifuge integration with Django framework.
* [centrifuge-ruby](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-ruby) - Ruby gem to communicate with Centrifuge/Centrifugo
